"""
Current Plan for Code:
- Create centralized function file and remove functions from other parts of the programs. 
- Centralize each step of the generation and analysis process into a singular program 
- Make a text list for importing all packages necessary. 
- Make an GUI for starting and stopping different steps in conditinals/distributions/test morphologies/etc. generation 
    - Use the gui to selectively look at given graphs
