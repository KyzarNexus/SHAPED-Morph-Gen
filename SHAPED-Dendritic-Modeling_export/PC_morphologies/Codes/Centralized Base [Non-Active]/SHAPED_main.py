Purpose: To create a centralized exploratory data analysis platform upon which to employ custom functions and view visual representations of results. 

The work flow for analysis is as follows

Original Dataset (.swc) is split into two processing streams:
-Point Process Generation
-Creating Conditional Relationships

The results of these two pathways are inputted into a point process filter and estimation maximization program that generates new .swc morphology files

The resulting morphology group(s) is inputted into a distribution measurer and compared for closeness to original dataset.
